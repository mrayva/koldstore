# Architecture

pg-koldstore adds tiered storage to normal PostgreSQL heap tables. Tiered
storage places data on different storage media according to performance,
access, and cost needs. In KoldStore, the hot tier is the PostgreSQL heap and
its native indexes; the cold tier is compressed Parquet on a configured
filesystem or object store.

PostgreSQL remains the transaction, locking, permission, and MVCC authority for
rows in the hot heap. KoldStore adds a change-log mirror, cold Parquet segments,
and an experimental `KoldMergeScan` custom scan for a supported subset of
`SELECT` through the original relation. PostgreSQL still evaluates the scan's
ordinary quals and RLS policies, but cold rows are not heap tuples: system
columns, row locks, predicate locking, native constraints, and complete
snapshot semantics do not automatically extend to them. Tier placement is policy-driven:
today, a hot-row limit selects older mirror sequence values for flush rather
than measuring row access frequency automatically.

These documents describe **what the code does today**, including serde
boundaries at each step:

| Managed-table lifecycle and DDL identity changes | [managed-table-lifecycle](architecture/managed-table-lifecycle.md) |
| Register a table for hot/cold management | [manage-table](architecture/manage-table.md) |
| Mirror capture (WAL apply) | [mirror-capture](architecture/mirror-capture.md) |
| Move mirror rows to Parquet and prune hot | [flushing-table](architecture/flushing-table.md) |
| `SELECT` through hot + cold merge | [scanning-table](architecture/scanning-table.md) |
| `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` capture | [dml-table](architecture/dml-table.md) |
| Jobs, worker, and automatic flush | [jobs-and-scheduler](architecture/jobs-and-scheduler.md) |

Worker **process lifecycle** (postmaster-forked backends: persistent WAL
applier, ephemeral maintenance, one-shot flush executors, and the 30-second
intervals) is in
[jobs-and-scheduler — Process lifecycle](architecture/jobs-and-scheduler.md#process-lifecycle).

## Core design choices

### Clean-schema mirror (no heap system columns)

Managed user tables keep application columns only. Sequence and delete state
live in a schema-qualified mirror named
`koldstore.<schema>_<table>__cl` (with a stable hash fallback for long names)
and in cold Parquet metadata (`seq`, `deleted`).
Committed primary-key-only WAL is applied to the mirror by a persistent
per-database WAL applier, with an explicit committed-change fence. The fence
cannot observe the caller's uncommitted writes and must precede a fixed
`REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE` snapshot that is expected to include the
captured commits.
UPDATE uses a direct set-based update for existing mirror keys and a
conflict-safe insert-missing fallback for keys already pruned by flush. The
applier drains bounded batches on commit latch wakes (with a 30 s watchdog for
missed hints) and holds no transaction while idle. See
[dml-table](architecture/dml-table.md) and
[mirror capture](architecture/mirror-capture.md).

### Custom scan instead of an external query engine

KoldMergeScan streams hot pages and cold segment groups through an exact
winner resolver, retaining PK identities (not full row images) for the scan.
See [scanning-table](architecture/scanning-table.md).

### Manifest and catalog

`koldstore.manifest` tracks sync state and O(1) row counters. Object-store
export is folder-sharded (`manifest.json` root + content-addressed folder shards)
and is written on flush finalize. Cold segment metadata lives in
`koldstore.cold_segments`. See [flushing-table](architecture/flushing-table.md).

### Operational boundaries

Object storage is not part of PostgreSQL WAL. Operators must back up cold
artifacts together with PostgreSQL base backups and validate manifest identity
before PITR cutover. For async capture, retained WAL is health telemetry that
must alert operators without disabling the applier; PostgreSQL disk and logical
slot-retention controls remain independent hard safeguards.
